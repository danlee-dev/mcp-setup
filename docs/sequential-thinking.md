# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

Structured problem-solving and reasoning framework for complex analytical tasks.

## Description

The Sequential Thinking MCP server provides a framework for breaking down complex problems into structured, step-by-step reasoning processes. It helps organize thoughts, track analysis progress, and ensure thorough consideration of all relevant factors.

## Setup

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### Configuration

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Problem Analysis

2. **Gather information**: Collect relevant data and constraints
3. **Generate options**: Brainstorm possible solutions
4. **Evaluate alternatives**: Compare pros and cons systematically
5. **Make decision**: Choose best option based on analysis
6. **Document rationale**: Record reasoning for future reference

#### Code Review Process

1. **Understand requirements**: Review specifications and acceptance criteria
2. **Analyze structure**: Examine overall code organization
3. **Check functionality**: Verify logic and behavior
4. **Review quality**: Assess maintainability and best practices
5. **Provide feedback**: Offer constructive suggestions
6. **Track resolution**: Monitor issue addressing

## Thinking Frameworks

### Linear Analysis
- **Sequential steps**: Progress through ordered stages
- **Dependency tracking**: Ensure prerequisites are met
- **Progress monitoring**: Track completion status
- **Result validation**: Verify outcomes at each step

### Comparative Analysis  
- **Option identification**: List all viable alternatives
- **Criteria definition**: Establish evaluation factors
- **Scoring system**: Rate options against criteria
- **Ranking process**: Order alternatives by score

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem definition**: Clearly describe the issue
- **Evidence collection**: Gather supporting data
- **Hypothesis formation**: Propose potential causes
- **Testing process**: Validate or refute hypotheses
- **Solution development**: Address identified causes

## Best Practices

### Structure Organization
1. **Clear objectives**: Define what you're trying to achieve
2. **Logical sequence**: Arrange steps in meaningful order
3. **Complete coverage**: Ensure all aspects are considered
4. **Documentation**: Record reasoning and decisions

### Analysis Quality
1. **Thorough research**: Gather comprehensive information
2. **Multiple perspectives**: Consider different viewpoints
3. **Evidence-based**: Support conclusions with data
4. **Bias awareness**: Recognize and mitigate cognitive biases

### Process Management
